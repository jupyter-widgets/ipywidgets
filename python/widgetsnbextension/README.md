This package makes Jupyter widgets available in the classic Jupyter Notebook. This package provides the necessary JavaScript controls in the Jupyter Notebook that communicate with the widget objects in the kernel.

Install the corresponding Jupyter widgets package into your kernel, i.e., IPython users would install `ipywidgets` into their kernel.
