# Developer Release Procedure

To release a new version of the widgets on PyPI and npm, first checkout the
`main` branch and `cd` into the repo root.

```
cd release
conda deactivate
conda remove --all -y -n releasewidgets
rm -rf ipywidgets

conda create -c conda-forge --override-channels -y -n releasewidgets notebook nodejs "yarn=3.*" twine jupyterlab=4 jupyter-packaging python-build jq "python==3.10.*"
conda activate releasewidgets

git clone git@github.com:jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets.git
cd ipywidgets
```

## Fix the widget spec

If there were changes in the widget model specification (i.e., any change made
to any widget attributes), we need to update the model specification version and
record the documented attributes.

First, update the relevant model specification versions. For example, the commit https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/commit/fca6f355605dc9e04062ce0eec4a7acbb5632ae2 updated the controls model version. We follow the semver spec for model version numbers, so model changes that are backwards-incompatible should be major version bumps, while backwards-compatible additions should be minor version bumps.

Next, regenerate the model spec with the new version numbers by doing something like this in the repository root directory:

```
(cd python/ipywidgets; pip install -e .)
python ./packages/schema/generate-spec.py -f json-pretty packages/schema/jupyterwidgetmodels.latest.json
python ./packages/schema/generate-spec.py -f markdown packages/schema/jupyterwidgetmodels.latest.md
```

Copy `packages/schema/jupyterwidgetmodels.latest.md` to an appropriately-named
markdown file (see the existing model spec files in that directory for the
naming convention). This documents the widget model specification for a specific ipywidget
release.

Commit the changes (don't forget to `git add` the new model spec file).

## Publish the npm modules

```
# clean out all dirty files
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git reset --hard origin/main
git clean -fdx
yarn install
yarn run bump
# Check the latest commit to make sure it is correct
yarn publish
```

Lerna will prompt you for version numbers for each of the changed npm packages in the version step. Lerna will then change the versions appropriately (including the interdependency versions), commit, and tag. The `yarn publish` step then publishes the public packages that were versioned to npm.

## Configure twine username

If you have 2FA on, make sure you have your `~/.pypirc` file set to:

```
[pypi]
username = __token__
```

Or set the environment variable

```
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
```

## `jupyterlab_widgets`

Go into the `python/jupyterlab_widgets` directory. Change `jupyterlab_widgets/_version.py` to reflect the new version number.

```
(cd python/jupyterlab_widgets && pyproject-build . && twine upload dist/*)
```

Verify that the package is uploaded.

```
curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/jupyterlab-widgets/json | jq  -r '[.releases[][] | [.upload_time, .digests.sha256, .filename] | join(" ")] | sort '
```

## `widgetsnbextension`

Go into the `python/widgetsnbextension` directory. Change `widgetsnbextension/_version.py` to reflect the new version number.

```
(cd python/widgetsnbextension && pyproject-build . && twine upload dist/*)
```

Verify that the package is uploaded.

```
curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/widgetsnbextension/json | jq  -r '[.releases[][] | [.upload_time, .digests.sha256, .filename] | join(" ")] | sort '
```

## `ipywidgets`

Go into the `python/ipywidgets` directory. Change `ipywidgets/_version.py` to reflect the new version number, and if necessary, a new `__html_manager_version__`. Change the `install_requires` parameter in `setup.cfg` reference the new widgetsnbextension and jupyterlab_widgets version.

```
(cd python/ipywidgets && pyproject-build . && twine upload dist/*)
```

Verify that the package is uploaded:

```
curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/ipywidgets/json | jq  -r '[.releases[][] | [.upload_time, .digests.sha256, .filename] | join(" ")] | sort '
```

## Push changes back

Calculate the hashes of the uploaded files. You could use a small shell script, for example, like this on macOS (put in `scripts/hashes`):

```sh
#!/bin/sh
for f in $@
do
  echo "$f"
  echo md5: `md5 -q "$f"`
  echo sha1: `shasum -a 1 "$f" | awk '{print $1}'`
  echo sha256: `shasum -a 256 "$f" | awk '{print $1}'`
  echo
done
```

Using the above script, you can do:

```
./scripts/hashes python/ipywidgets/dist/*
./scripts/hashes python/widgetsnbextension/dist/*
./scripts/hashes python/jupyterlab_widgets/dist/*
```

Commit the changes you've made above, and include the uploaded files hashes in the commit message. Tag the release if ipywidgets was released. Push to origin `main` (and include the tag in the push), e.g:

```
git add -p
git commit -m "Release: ipywidgets 8.1.3, widgetsnbextension 4.0.11, jupyterlab_widgets 3.0.11"
git commit --amend
git tag 8.1.3
git push origin main 8.1.3
```

Update conda-forge packages (if the requirements changed to ipywidgets, make sure to update widgetsnbextension first).

# Release Notes

## Changelog

- Modify `scripts/milestone_check.py` to include the release and commit range for the release, and run `python scripts/milestone_check.py` to check the issues assigned to this milestone
- Write release highlights. You can use the list generated below as a starting point:
  ```bash
  loghub jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets -m XXX -t $GITHUB_TOKEN --template scripts/release_template.txt
  ```

## Example

Here is an example of the release statistics for ipywidgets 7.0.

It has been 157 days since the last release. In this release, we closed [127 issues](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A7.0) and [216 pull requests](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A7.0+is%3Aclosed) with [1069](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/compare/6.0.0...7.0.0) commits, of which 851 are not merges.

Here are some commands used to generate some of the statistics above.

```
# merges since in 6.0.0, but not 7.0.0, which is a rough list of merged PRs
git log --merges 6.0.0...main --pretty=oneline

# To really make sure we get all PRs, we could write a program that
# pulled all of the PRs, examined a commit in each one, and did
# `git tag --contains <commit number>` to see if that PR commit is included
# in a previous release.

# issues closed with no milestone in the time period
# is:issue is:closed closed:"2016-07-14 .. 2017-02-28"

# date of 6.0.0 tag
git show -s --format=%cd --date=short 6.0.0^{commit}

# Non-merge commits in 7.0.0 not in any 6.x release
git log --pretty=oneline --no-merges ^6.0.0 main | wc -l

# Authors of non-merge commits
git shortlog -s  6.0.0..main --no-merges | cut -c8- | sort -f

# New committers: authors unique in the 6.0.0..7.0.0 logs, but not in the 6.0.0 log
comm -23 <(git shortlog -s -n 6.0.0..main --no-merges | cut -c8- | sort) <(git shortlog -s -n 6.0.0 --no-merges | cut -c8- | sort) | sort -f
```
