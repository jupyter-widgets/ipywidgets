# Developer Install

The core Jupyter Widgets packages are developed in the
[https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) git repository.


## Prerequisites

To install ipywidgets from git, you will need:

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager ** version 1.2.1 or later **

- the latest [Jupyter Notebook development release](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases)
  + Everything in the ipywidgets repository is developed using Jupyter
    notebook's master branch.
  + If you want to have a copy of ipywidgets that works against a stable
    version of the notebook, checkout the appropriate tag.
  + See the
    [Compatibility table](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets#compatibility)
    
- the latest [JupyterLab release](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases)



### Installing With Conda 

```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -n ipywidgets yarn notebook
conda activate ipywidgets
ipython kernel install --name ipywidgets --display-name "ipywidgets" --sys-prefix
pip install --pre jupyterlab
git clone https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets.git
cd ipywidgets
./dev-install.sh
```

Notice that we install the prerelease of JupyterLab currently, which is only available via `pip`.

Rebuilding after making changes
----------------------------

To build and test changes, run the following commands in the ipywidgets repository root directory, empty your browser's cache, and refresh the page.

        yarn run clean
        yarn run build

If your changes are confined to one package (for example, just in the widgetsnbextension package), then it may be sufficient to just run `yarn run build` in that specific directory.

Tips and troubleshooting
------------------------

- If you have any problems with the above install procedure, make sure that
permissions on npm and pip related install directories are correct.

- Sometimes, it helps to clear cached files too by running `git clean -dfx`
  from the root of the cloned repository.

- When you make changes to the Javascript and you're not seeing the changes,
 it could be your browser is caching aggressively. Try clearing the browser's
 cache. Try also using "incognito" or "private" browsing tabs to avoid
 caching.

- If troubleshooting an upgrade and its build, you may need to do the
  following process:

    - Deep clean of the cloned repository:

      ```
      git clean -dfx .
      ```

    - Remove anything with `widgetsnbextension` in the name of files within
        the `conda` directory

    - Try reinstalling ipywidgets

Updating widget model specification
-----------------------------------

To update the widget model specification with changes, do something like this in the repo root:
```
python ./packages/schema/generate-spec.py > packages/schema/jupyterwidgetmodels.latest.md
```

Releasing new versions
----------------------

See [dev_release.md](dev_release.md) for a details on how to release new versions of ipywidgets to PyPI and jupyter-widgets-controls on npm.

Testing
-------

See [dev_testing.md](dev_testing.md) for a details on how to run Python and Javascript tests.

Building documentation
----------------------

See [dev_docs.md](dev_docs.md) for a details on how to build the docs.
